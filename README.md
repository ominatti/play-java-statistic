# play-java-example

This project demonstrates how to calculate realtime statistic from the last 60 seconds.
There will be two APIs, one of them is
called every time a transaction is made. It is also the sole input of this rest API. The other one
returns the statistic based of the transactions of the last 60 seconds.

Technologies:

* Java
* Play
* MultiThreading
* ehcache( used just for testing not used in the implementation)
